## 0.12.0 — 2025-12-23
- Widgets: add WidgetKit extension backed by a shared app‑group usage snapshot.
- New local cost usage tracking (Codex + Claude) via a lightweight scanner — inspired by ccusage (MIT). Computes cost from local JSONL logs without Node CLIs. Thanks @ryoppippi!
- Cost summary now includes last‑30‑days tokens; weekly pace indicators (with runout copy) hide when usage is fully depleted. Thanks @Remedy92!
- Claude: PTY probes now stop after idle, auto‑clean on restart, and run under a watchdog to avoid runaway CLI processes.
- Menu polish: group history under card sections, simplify history labels, and refresh menus live while open.
- Performance: faster usage log scanning + cost parsing; cache menu icons and speed up OpenAI dashboard parsing.
- Sparkle: auto-download updates when auto-check is enabled, and only show the restart menu entry once an update is ready.
- Widgets: experimental WidgetKit extension (may require restarting the widget gallery/Dock to appear).
- Credits: show credits as a progress bar and add a credits history chart when OpenAI web data is available.
- Credits: move “Buy Credits…” into its own menu item and improve auto-start checkout flow.

## 0.11.2 — 2025-12-21
- ccusage-codex cost fetch is faster and more reliable by limiting the session scan window.
- Fix ccusage cost fetch hanging for large Codex histories by draining subprocess output while commands run.
- Fix merged-icon loading animation when another provider is fetching (only the selected provider animates).
- CLI PATH capture now uses an interactive login shell and merges with the app PATH, fixing missing Node/Codex/Claude/Gemini resolution for NVM-style installs.

## 0.11.1 — 2025-12-21
- Gemini OAuth token refresh now supports Bun/npm installations. Thanks @ben-vargas!

## 0.11.0 — 2025-12-21
- New optional cost display in the menu (session + last 30 days), powered by ccusage. Thanks @Xuanwo!
- Fix loading-state card spacing to avoid double separators.

## 0.10.0 — 2025-12-20
- Gemini provider support (usage, plan detection, login flow). Thanks @381181295!
- Unified menu bar icon mode with a provider switcher and Merge Icons toggle (default on when multiple providers are enabled). Thanks @ibehnam!
- Fix regression from 0.9.1 where CLI detection failed for some installs by restoring interactive login-shell PATH loading.

## 0.9.1 — 2025-12-19
- CLI resolution now uses the login shell PATH directly (no more heuristic path scanning), so Codex/Claude match your shell config reliably.

## 0.9.0 — 2025-12-19
- New optional OpenAI web access: reuses your signed-in Safari/Chrome session to show **Code review remaining**, **Usage breakdown**, and **Credits usage history** in the menu (no credentials stored).
- Credits still come from the Codex CLI; OpenAI web access is only used for the dashboard extras above.
- OpenAI web sessions auto-sync to the Codex CLI email, support multiple accounts, and reset/re-import cookies on account switches to avoid stale cross-account data.
- Fix Chrome cookie import (macOS 10): signed-in Chrome sessions are detected reliably (thanks @tobihagemann!).
- Usage breakdown submenu: compact chart with hover details for day/service totals.
- New “Show usage as used” toggle to invert progress bars (default remains “% left”, now in Advanced).
- Session (5-hour) reset now shows a relative countdown (“Resets in 3h 31m”) in the menu card for Codex and Claude.
- Claude: fix reset parsing so “Resets …” can’t be mis-attributed to the wrong window (session vs weekly).

## 0.8.1 — 2025-12-17
- Claude trust prompts (“Do you trust the files in this folder?”) are now auto-accepted during probes to prevent stuck refreshes. Thanks @tobihagemann!

## 0.8.0 — 2025-12-17
- CodexBar is now available via Homebrew: `brew install --cask steipete/tap/codexbar` (updates via `brew upgrade --cask steipete/tap/codexbar`).
- Added session quota notifications for the sliding 5-hour window (Codex + Claude): notifies when it hits 0% and when it’s available again, based only on observed refresh data (including startup when already depleted). Thanks @GKannanDev!

## 0.7.3 — 2025-12-17
- Claude Enterprise accounts whose Claude Code `/usage` panel only shows “Current session” no longer fail parsing; weekly usage is treated as unavailable (fixes #19).

## 0.7.2 — 2025-12-13
- Claude “Open Dashboard” now routes subscription accounts (Max/Pro/Ultra/Team) to the usage page instead of the API console billing page. Thanks @auroraflux!
- Codex/Claude binary resolution now detects mise/rtx installs (shims and newest installed tool version), fixing missing CLI detection for mise users. Thanks @philipp-spiess!
- Claude usage/status probes now auto-accept the first-run “Ready to code here?” permission prompt (when launched from Finder), preventing timeouts and parse errors. Thanks @alexissan!
- General preferences now surface full Codex/Claude fetch errors with one-click copy and expandable details, reducing first-run confusion when a CLI is missing.
- Polished the menu bar “critter” icons: Claude is now a crisper, blockier pixel crab, and Codex has punchier eyes with reduced blurring in SwiftUI/menu rendering.

## 0.7.1 — 2025-12-09
- Menu bar icons now render on a true 18 pt/2× backing with pixel-aligned bars and overlays for noticeably crisper edges.
- PTY runner now preserves the caller’s environment (HOME/TERM/bun installs) while enriching PATH, preventing Codex/Claude
  probes from failing when CLIs are installed via bun/nvm or need their auth/config paths.
- Added regression tests to lock in the enriched environment behavior.
- Fixed a first-launch crash on macOS 26 caused by the 1×1 keepalive window triggering endless constraint updates; the hidden
  window now uses a safe size and no longer spams SwiftUI state warnings.
- Menu action rows now ship with SF Symbol icons (refresh, dashboard, status, settings, about, quit, copy error) for clearer at-a-glance affordances.
- When the Codex CLI is missing, menu and CLI now surface an actionable install hint (`npm i -g @openai/codex` / bun) instead of a generic PATH error.
- Node manager (nvm/fnm) resolution corrected so codex/claude binaries — and their `node` — are found reliably even when installed via fnm aliases or nvm defaults. Thanks @aliceisjustplaying for surfacing the gaps.
- Login menu now shows phase-specific subtitles and disables interaction while running: “Requesting login…” while starting the CLI, then “Waiting in browser…” once the auth URL is printed; success still triggers the macOS notification.
- Login state is tracked per provider so Codex and Claude icons/menus no longer share the same in-flight status when switching accounts.
- Claude login PTY runner detects the auth URL without clearing buffers, keeps the session alive until confirmation, and exposes a Sendable phase callback used by the menu.
- Claude CLI detection now includes Claude Code’s self-updating paths (`~/.claude/local/claude`, `~/.claude/bin/claude`) so PTY probes work even when only the bundled installer is used.

## 0.7.0 — 2025-12-07
- ✨ New rich menu card with inline progress bars and reset times for each provider, giving the menu a beautiful, at-a-glance dashboard feel (credit: Anton Sotkov @antons).

## 0.6.1 — 2025-12-07
- Claude CLI probes stop passing `--dangerously-skip-permissions`, aligning with the default permission prompt and avoiding hidden first-run failures.

## 0.6.0 — 2025-12-04
- New bundled CLI (`codexbar`) with single `usage` command, `--format text|json`, `--status`, and fast `-h/-V`.
- CLI output now shows consistent headers (`Codex 0.x.y (codex-cli)`, `Claude Code <ver> (claude)`) and JSON includes `source` + `status`.
- Advanced prefs install button symlinks `codexbar` into /usr/local/bin and /opt/homebrew/bin; docs refreshed.

## 0.5.7 — 2025-11-26
- Status Page and Usage Dashboard menu actions now honor the icon you click; Codex menus no longer open the Claude status site.

## 0.5.6 — 2025-11-25
- New playful “Surprise me” option adds occasional blinks/tilts/wiggles to the menu bar icons (one random effect at a time) plus a Debug “Blink now” trigger.
- Preferences now include an Advanced tab (refresh cadence, Surprise me toggle, Debug visibility); window height trimmed ~20% for a tighter fit.
- Motion timing eased and lengthened so blinks/wiggles feel smoother and less twitchy.

## 0.5.5 — 2025-11-25
- Claude usage scrape now recognizes the new “Current week (Sonnet only)” bar while keeping the legacy Opus label as a fallback.
- Menu and docs now label the Claude tertiary limit as Sonnet to match the latest CLI wording.
- PATH seeding now uses a deterministic binary locator plus a one-shot login-shell capture at startup (no globbed nvm paths); the Debug tab shows the resolved Codex binary and effective PATH layers.

## 0.5.4 — 2025-11-24
- Status blurb under “Status Page” no longer prefixes the text with “Status:”, keeping the incident description concise.
- PTY runner now registers cleanup before launch so both ends of the TTY and the process group are torn down even when `Process.run()` throws (no leaked fds when spawn fails).

## 0.5.3 — 2025-11-22
- Added a per-provider “Status Page” menu item beneath Usage that opens the provider’s live status page (OpenAI or Claude).
- Status API now refreshes alongside usage; incident states show a dot/! overlay on the status icon plus a status blurb under the menu item.
- General preferences now include a default-on “Check provider status” toggle above refresh cadence.

## 0.5.2 — 2025-11-22
- Release packaging now includes uploading the dSYM archive alongside the app zip to aid crash symbolication (policy documented in the shared mac release guide).
- Claude PTY fallback removed: Claude probes now rely solely on `script` stdout parsing, and the generic TTY runner is trimmed to Codex `/status` handling.
- Fixed a busy-loop on the codex RPC stderr pipe (handler now detaches on EOF), eliminating the long-running high-CPU spin reported in issue #9.

## 0.5.1 — 2025-11-22
- Debug pane now exposes the Claude parse dump toggle, keeping the captured raw scrape in memory for inspection.
- Claude About/debug views embed the current git hash so builds can be identified precisely.
- Minor runtime robustness tweaks in the PTY runner and usage fetcher.

## 0.5.0 — 2025-11-22
- Codex usage/credits now use the codex app-server RPC by default (with PTY `/status` fallback when RPC is unavailable), reducing flakiness and speeding refreshes.
- Codex CLI launches seed PATH with Homebrew/bun/npm/nvm/fnm defaults to avoid ENOENT in hardened/release builds; TTY probes reuse the same PATH.
- Claude CLI probe now runs `/usage` and `/status` in parallel (no simulated typing), captures reset strings, and uses a resilient parser (label-first with ordered fallback) while keeping org/email separate by provider.
- TTY runner now always tears down the spawned process group (even on early Claude login prompts) to avoid leaking CLI processes.
- Default refresh cadence is now 5 minutes, and a 15-minute option was added to the settings picker.
- Claude probes/version detection now start with `--allowed-tools ""` (tool access disabled) while keeping interactive PTY mode working.
- Codex probes and version detection now launch the CLI with `-s read-only -a untrusted` to keep PTY runs sandboxed.
- Codex warm-up screens (“data not available yet”) are handled gracefully: cached credits stay visible and the menu skips the scary parse error.
- Codex reset times are shown for both RPC and TTY fallback, and plan labels are capitalized while emails stay verbatim.

## 0.4.3 — 2025-11-21
- Fix status item creation timing on macOS 15 by deferring NSStatusItem setup to after launch; adds a regression test for the path.
- Menu bar icon with unknown usage now draws empty tracks (instead of a full bar when decorations are shown) by treating nil values as 0%.

## 0.4.2 — 2025-11-21
- Sparkle updates re-enabled in release builds (disabled only for the debug bundle ID).

## 0.4.1 — 2025-11-21
- Both Codex and Claude probes now run off the main thread (background PTY), avoiding menu/UI stalls during `/status` or `/usage` fetches.
- Codex credits stay available even when `/status` times out: cached values are kept and errors are surfaced separately.
- Claude/Codex provider autodetect runs on first launch (defaults to Codex if neither is installed) with a debug reset button.
- Sparkle updates re-enabled in release builds (disabled only for debug bundle ID).
- Claude probe now issues the `/usage` slash command directly to land on the Usage tab reliably and avoid palette misfires.

## 0.4.0 — 2025-11-21
- Claude Code support: dedicated Claude menu/icon plus dual-wired menus when both providers are enabled; shows email/org/plan and Sonnet usage with clickable errors.
- New Preferences window: General/About tabs with provider toggles, refresh cadence, start-at-login, and always-on Quit.
- Codex credits without web login: we now read `codex /status` in a PTY, auto-skip the update prompt, and parse session/weekly/credits; cached credits stay visible on transient timeouts.
- Resilience: longer PTY timeouts, cached-credit fallback, one-line menu errors, and clearer parse/update messages.

## 0.3.0 — 2025-11-18
- Credits support: reads Codex CLI `/status` via PTY (no browser login), shows remaining credits inline, and moves history to a submenu.
- Sign-in window with cookie reuse and a logout/clear-cookies action; waits out workspace picker and auto-navigates to usage page.
- Menu: credits line bolded; login prompt hides once credits load; debug toggle always visible (HTML dump).
- Icon: when weekly is empty, top bar becomes a thick credits bar (capped at 1k); otherwise bars stay 5h/weekly.

## 0.2.2 — 2025-11-17
- Menu bar icon stays static when no account/usage is present; loading animation only runs while fetching (12 fps) to keep idle CPU low.
- Usage refresh first tails the newest session log (512 KB window) before scanning everything, reducing IO on large Codex logs.
- Packaging/signing hardened: strip extended attributes, delete AppleDouble (`._*`) files, and re-sign Sparkle + app bundle to satisfy Gatekeeper.

## 0.2.1 — 2025-11-17
- Patch bump for refactor/relative-time changes; packaging scripts set to 0.2.1 (5).
- Streamlined Codex usage parsing: modern rate-limit handling, flexible reset time parsing, and account rate-limit updates (thanks @jazzyalex and https://jazzyalex.github.io/agent-sessions/).

## 0.2.0 — 2025-11-16
- CADisplayLink-based loading animations (macOS 15 displayLink API) with randomized patterns (Knight Rider, Cylon, outside-in, race, pulse) and debug replay cycling through all.
- Debug replay toggle (`defaults write com.steipete.codexbar debugMenuEnabled -bool YES`) to view every pattern.
- Usage Dashboard link in menu; menu layout tweaked.
- Updated time now shows relative formatting when fresher than 24h; refactored sources into smaller files for maintainability.
- Version bumped to 0.2.0 (4).

## 0.1.2 — 2025-11-16
- Animated loading icon (dual bars sweep until usage arrives); always uses rendered template icon.
- Sparkle embedding/signing fixed with deep+timestamp; notarization pipeline solid.
- Icon conversion scripted via ictool with docs.
- Menu: settings submenu, no GitHub item; About link clickable.

## 0.1.1 — 2025-11-16
- Launch-at-login toggle (SMAppService) and saved preference applied at startup.
- Sparkle auto-update wiring (SUFeedURL to GitHub, SUPublicEDKey set); Settings submenu with auto-update toggle + Check for Updates.
- Menu cleanup: settings grouped, GitHub menu removed, About link clickable.
- Usage parser scans newest session logs until it finds `token_count` events.
- Icon pipeline fixed: regenerated `.icns` via ictool with proper transparency (docs in docs/icon.md).
- Added lint/format configs, Swift Testing, strict concurrency, and usage parser tests.
- Notarized release build "CodexBar-0.1.0.zip" remains current artifact; app version 0.1.1.

## 0.1.0 — 2025-11-16
- Initial CodexBar release: macOS 15+ menu bar app, no Dock icon.
- Reads latest Codex CLI `token_count` events from session logs (5h + weekly usage, reset times); no extra login or browser scraping.
- Shows account email/plan decoded locally from `auth.json`.
- Horizontal dual-bar icon (top = 5h, bottom = weekly); dims on errors.
- Configurable refresh cadence, manual refresh, and About links.
- Async off-main log parsing for responsiveness; strict-concurrency build flags enabled.
- Packaging + signing/notarization scripts (arm64); build scripts convert `.icon` bundle to `.icns`.
